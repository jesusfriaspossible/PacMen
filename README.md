# Description
An exercise inspired by the concepts taught by Dr. John Williams in the MITxPRO MERN course. It involves creating a Pac-Men character that can navigate around the screen.

# How to run
Open html file (index.html) with your browser.

# Roadmap of future improvements
Enhancements to the user interface: When Pac-Men is in motion, the button transforms into a 'Stop' button. Pac-Men can be guided in all four directions using the arrow keys.
